<h1>Mousepad v. Touchscreen</h1>
<h2>Grace Kroeger, Doug Walter, and Kyle Favret</h2>

<p>  
We tested 11 different conditions (6 trials, 3 subjects, mousepad, and the touchscreen). First was Kyle who tested the touchscreen then the mousepad, then Grace who tested the mousepad then the trackpad, and 
finally Doug who tested the mousepad then the touchscreen. The findings were that the touchscreen outperformed the mousepad-- the touchscreen's TP average was 6.094 and the mousepad's TP average was 3.674.
